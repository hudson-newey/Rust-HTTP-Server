# Rust HTTP Server

> A simple, not innovative server that can be used as a reference if you need a simple HTTP server which serves files.  
> Note: This server has zero security measures in place and willingly fall victim to a variety of basic attacks. I will be working on this in future increments, but at the moment, it is inherently insecure and should not be used in production.
